			    <p>Art is an important place in human life. All the arts of the world are made by emotions, if we use our emotions in the right place, then we can create any art within ourselves, If we see, it is an art that connects us with the world In fact, it is not easy to answer exactly what ‘art’ is. Expressing his view in relation to art, National Poet Maithili Sharan Gupta said – “The only power of expression is art.”

Art is the means of inner peace. This is hard penance, it is sadhana. It is through this that the artist embodies the dream ideas from the golden and rainbow soul.</p>
